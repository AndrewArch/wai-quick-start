## Assess the current situation and communicate existing barriers

Undertake a quick accessibility evaluation of key organizational websites to better understand the scale of any problems. Focus on key business activities to determine if people with disabilities are able to engage with your business. Use findings to help in subsequent communications with stakeholders and implementation teams.

## Secure management support for accessibility activities

Support from management helps ensure budget and resources are available for accessibility activities. Support will also help with prioritization when resource clashes occur. A strong business case, tailored to organizational goals, will help.

## Promote awareness for accessibility

Encourage awareness of the value and need for accessibility throughout the organization. Ensure that further information is available for those interested, and that there is a framework for them to communicate. Plan for follow up training and information, particularly for those involved in implementation activities.

## Seek alliances within the organization

Organizations may have many departments working on web implementation projects. Seek them out and bring them together. Provide shared training opportunities and look for opportunities to develop shared resources. Grow a network of people working on web projects interested in accessibility.

## Create feedback mechanisms

Provide a mechanism to gather feedback both internally and externally. Use the feedback to identify accessibility barriers, opportunities, and ideas. Ensure that the feedback is responded to positively, and fed into broader web implementation activities.

## Involve experts and people with disabilities

Experts and people with disabilities will help build understanding of the barriers faced and what accommodations can help in removing them. Stories of how people with disabilities use the web can also help develop understanding of the principles of and need for web accessibility. Use these stories as cases studies when building awareness and, potentially, as personas for implementation teams.
