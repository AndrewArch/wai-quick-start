## Perform initial cursory check to identify obvious issues

If evaluation only happens when code is near completion, then begin with a quick accessibility check to identify obvious issues. Results of such an evaluation will help determine the extent of any accessibility issues. Early visibility of issues will allow developers to begin assessing the problems and finding solutions.

## Select tools to assist in testing

Software tools can be used by evaluators as part of the evaluation process, to assist in determining compliance with assistive technologies, and to support large-scale content reviews across an entire website. Tools are often specialized, such as a color contrast checker, and may not cover every aspect of accessibility. Appreciate the limitations of the tools you select as well as their strengths.

## Use a standard reporting template for evaluations

Develop a standard report template so that repeated evaluations are comparable. Aim to summarize findings to allow for comparison throughout a projects life-cycle and across similar projects. Ensure that any report template covers every point in the accessibility guidelines accepted by the organization. A robust report template should also seek to capture details of what was evaluated and how the evaluation was performed, for example tools used, specific test data.

## Maintain a record of commonly identified issues

Following evaluations, seek to capture common issues and suggested solutions to aide subsequent development efforts. Try to provide a learning tool for development teams so that repetition of errors is reduced.

## Evaluate early and throughout development

Plan to run evaluations as early as possible, even at design phase. This will not identify all issues but should aim to catch relevant issues early to reduce the cost to fix. More thorough evaluations should be planned at key development milestones or when functional components are completed.

## Run evaluation sessions with real people

Seek feedback from people with disabilities on any materials being evaluated. This will help identify subtle issues, but will also emphasize the impact of any barriers. Be aware that everyone user is different. A problem for one user may just be due to their technology or skill level. Encourage members of the project team to observe sessions as it is helpful in building understanding of the importance of accessibility.

## Ensure final comprehensive evaluation

Run a full, comprehensive evaluation before go-live. Aim to cover all key website functions, all templates, and, where appropriate, a reasonable sample of general content pages. Evaluation should check each point in the accessibility guidelines accepted by the organization. Ensure that there is sufficient development time to address any issues with key components.

## Learn more about accessibility

These tips are important points to consider when evaluating website accessibility, but there is always more to learn. The following resources will help you find out more about accessibility, why it is important, and what guidelines exist to help support people with disabilities accessing the web.
