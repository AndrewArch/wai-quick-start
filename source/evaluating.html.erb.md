## Perform initial cursory check to identify obvious issues

Begin with a quick accessibility check to identify obvious issues. Results of such an evaluation will help determine the extent of any accessibility issues. Aim to identify accessibility issues as early as possible to reduce the cost of implementing solutions.

## Select tools to assist in testing

Software tools can help assist in determining compliance with assistive technologies, and support large-scale content reviews across an entire website. Tools are often specialized, such as a color contrast checker, and may not cover every aspect of accessibility. Avoid misrepresenting results by understanding the limitations and strengths of selected tools.

## Use a standard reporting template for evaluations

Develop a standard report template so that repeated evaluations are comparable. Include a summary of findings, to allow for easy comparison throughout a project and across similar projects. Ensure that any report template covers every point in the accessibility guidelines accepted by the organization. Include space to capture details of what was evaluated and how the evaluation was performed, for example tools used, specific test data.

## Maintain a record of commonly identified issues

Seek to capture commonly identified issues and suggested solutions to aide subsequent development efforts. Provide a learning tool for development teams so that repetition of errors is reduced.

## Evaluate early and throughout development

Run evaluations as early as possible, even during the design phase. This will not identify all issues but should aim to catch relevant issues early to reduce the cost to fix. Perform thorough evaluations at key development milestones or when functional components are completed.

## Run evaluation sessions with real people

Seek feedback from people with disabilities on any materials being evaluated. This will help identify subtle issues and will highlight the impact of any barriers. Be aware that every user is different. A problem for one user may just be due to their technology or skill level. Encourage members of the project team to observe sessions as it helps build understanding of the importance of accessibility.

## Ensure final comprehensive evaluation

Run a full, comprehensive evaluation before go-live. Aim to cover all key website functions, all templates, and a reasonable sample of general content pages. Evaluation should check each point in the accessibility guidelines accepted by the organization. Ensure that there is sufficient development time to address any issues with key content.
